## Documentation
- Executing the file [ERAPS_test.py](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/Ensemble-Regularized-Adaptive-Prediction-Set-ERAPS/blob/main/ERAPS_test.py) reproduces our results. Detailed documentation will be provided soon.
- The Table below compares `ERAPS` vs. three competing methods on the [MelbournePedestrian dataset](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=MelbournePedestrian), where we can see that ERAPS always maintains valid marginala coverage with much smaller prediction sets in some cases.
